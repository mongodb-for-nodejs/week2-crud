If you have any difficulty using MongoProc, here are 2 video lectures showing how to set it up.

Download MongoProc

Blog User Sign-up and Login

Download hw2-3.zip from the Download Handout link and uncompress it.

You should see four files in the 'blog' directory: app.js, users.js, posts.js and sessions.js. There is also a 'views' directory which contains the templates for the project and a 'routes' directory which contains our express routes.

If everything is working properly, you should be able to start the blog by typing:

````
npm install
node app.js
````
